## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

### Learn by Doing
- **Code First**: Run examples before reading theory
- **Experiment**: Modify parameters and observe changes
- **Break Things**: Understanding failures teaches as much as successes
- **Build Up**: Start simple, add complexity gradually

### Understand the Math
- **Visual**: See formulas in action with real numbers
- **Derivational**: Work through mathematical derivations
- **Intuitive**: Connect math to real-world meaning
- **Practical**: Implement formulas as code

### Best Practices from Day One
- **Clean Code**: Learn good programming habits
- **Documentation**: Read and write clear explanations
- **Testing**: Verify implementations work correctly
- **Debugging**: Systematic problem-solving skills

## 🔄 Iterative Learning Process

### 1. **Observe** (Run Examples)
```python
# Start with working code
python examples/complete_linear_regression.py
# See what it does before understanding how
```

### 2. **Question** (Why Does This Work?)
```python
# Look at the implementation
# Ask: Why this loss function? Why this optimizer?
# Understand the choices being made
```

### 3. **Modify** (Experiment)
```python
# Change hyperparameters
# Try different components
# See how results change
```

### 4. **Understand** (Study the Math)
```python
# Read mathematical_foundations.md
# Work through derivations
# Connect formulas to code
```

### 5. **Implement** (Build from Scratch)
```python
# Implement algorithms without looking
# Test against our reference implementation
# Debug differences
```

### 6. **Apply** (Real Projects)
```python
# Use your knowledge on new problems
# Combine components creatively
# Solve real-world challenges
```
